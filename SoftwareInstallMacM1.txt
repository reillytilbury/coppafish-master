Using Python 3.9

conda install pyqt
pip install napari
pip install --upgrade "jax[cpu]"
pip install tdqm
pip install numpy_indexed
conda install scikit-learn
pip install opencv-python
pip install nd2
pip install h5py
pip install matplotlib
pip install distinctipy


The initial condo pyqt install is to install the PyQt5 required by napari. This does not work with pip. If napari still does not appear to be working then, you may have to install pyqt with brew. See solution here:

I used conda to install scikit-learn because I donâ€™t think script installation works with pip.
