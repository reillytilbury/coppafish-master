    This function turns each tiff file in the tile directory into a point cloud, saving the results
    as `spot_details` in the `find_spots` notebook page.

    See `'find_spots'` section of `notebook_comments.json` file
    for description of the variables in the page.

    Args:
        config: Dictionary obtained from `'find_spots'` section of config file.
        nbp_file: `file_names` notebook page
        nbp_basic: `basic_info` notebook page
        auto_thresh: `float [n_tiles x n_rounds x n_channels]`.
            `auto_thresh[t, r, c]` is the threshold for the tiff file corresponding to tile `t`, round `r`, channel `c`
            such that all local maxima with pixel values greater than this are considered spots.
