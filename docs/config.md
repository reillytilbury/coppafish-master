	If `r_dapi` not specified. Will convert to units of pixels from this micron value. Typical = 8.0. If both this and `r_dapi` left blank, DAPI image will not be filtered and no .npy file saved. Instead DAPI will be loaded directly from raw data and then stitched. 

	Default: `None`

* **scale**: *maybe_number*.

	Each filtered image is multiplied by scale. This is because the image is saved as uint16 so to gain information from the decimal points, should multiply image so max pixel number is in the 10,000s (less than 65,536). Leave empty to auto-detect using `scale_norm`. 

	Default: `None`

	`psf` is assumed to be radially symmetric within each z-plane so assume all values within annulus of this size (in xy_pixels) to be the same. 

	Default: `1.4`

* **wiener_constant**: *number*.

	Constant used to compute wiener filter from `psf`. 

	Default: `50000`

	 Size of `r_smooth` has big influence on time taken for smoothing. For a `2048 x 2048 x 50` image: 

	 * `r_smooth = 1, 1, 2`: 2.8 seconds 

	 * `r_smooth = 2, 2, 2`: 8.5 seconds 

	 Leave empty to do no smoothing.

	Default: `None`

* **n_clip_error_images_thresh**: *int*.

	If the number of pixels that are clipped when saving as uint16 is more than `n_clip_error` for `n_clip_error_images_thresh` images, the extract and filter step will be halted.

	3D data is converted into `np.ceil(nz / nz_collapse)` 2D slices for exhaustive shift search to quicken it up. I.e. this is the maximum number of z-planes to be collapsed to a 2D slice when searching for the best shift. 

	Default: `30`

* **n_shifts_error_fraction**: *number*.

	Used in *coppafish/stitch/check_shifts/check_shifts_register* If more than this fraction of `shifts` between the `ref_round`/`ref_channel` and each imaging round for each tile have `score < score_thresh`, an error will be raised. 

	Default: `0.5`

## register
The *register* section contains parameters which specify how the affine transforms from the ref_round/ref_channel to each imaging round/channel are found from the shifts found in the *register_initial* section.

* **n_iter**: *int*.

	Maximum number iterations to run point cloud registration, PCR 

	Default: `100`

* **neighb_dist_thresh_2d**: *number*.

	Basically the distance in yx pixels below which neighbours are a good match. PCR updates transforms by minimising distances between neighbours which are closer than this. 

	Default: `3`

* **neighb_dist_thresh_3d**: *number*.

	The same as `neighb_dist_thresh_2d` but in 3D, we use a larger distance because the size of a z-pixel is greater than a xy pixel. 

	Default: `5`

* **matches_thresh_fract**: *number*.

	If PCR produces transforms with fewer neighbours (pairs with distance between them less than `neighb_dist_thresh`) than `matches_thresh = np.clip(matches_thresh_fract * n_spots, matches_thresh_min, matches_thresh_max)`, the transform will be re-evaluated with regularization so it is near the average transform. 

	Default: `0.25`

* **matches_thresh_min**: *int*.

	If PCR produces transforms with fewer neighbours (pairs with distance between them less than `neighb_dist_thresh`) than `matches_thresh = np.clip(matches_thresh_fract * n_spots, matches_thresh_min, matches_thresh_max)`, the transform will be re-evaluated with regularization so it is near the average transform. 

	Default: `25`

* **matches_thresh_max**: *int*.

	Default: `0.01, 0.01, 0.1`

* **shift_dev_thresh**: *list_number*.

	If a transform has a `shift[i]` that has an absolute deviation of more than `shift_dev_thresh[i]` from the median for that tile and round in any dimension `i`, it will be re-evaluated with regularization. There is a threshold for the y, x, z shift. `shift_dev_thresh[2]` is in z pixels. 

	Default: `15, 15, 5`

* **regularize_constant**: *int*.

	Constant used when doing regularized least squares. If the number of neighbours are above this, regularization will have little effect. If the number of neighbours is less than this, regularization will have significant effect, and final transform will be similar to transform being regularized towards. 

	Default: `500`

* **regularize_factor**: *number*.

	The loss function for finding the transform through regularized least squares is: 

	 $\sum_s^{n_{neighb}}D_s^2 + 0.5\lambda (\mu D_{scale}^2 + D_{shift}^2)$ 

	 Where: 

	 * $D_s^2$ is the squared distance between the pair of neighbours indicated by $s$. Only neighbours with distance between them on previous iteration les than `neighb_dist` are considered. 

	 * $\lambda$ is `regularize_constant`. 

	 * $\mu$ is `regularize_factor` such that when $n_{neighb} = \lambda$ and $D_s^2 = D_{shift}^2$ for all $s$, the two contributions to the loss function are approximately equal i.e. $\mu = D_{shift}^2/D_{scale}^2$. 

	 * $D_{scale}^2$ is the squared distance between `transform[:3, :]` and `transform_regularize[:3, :]`. I.e. the squared difference of the scaling/rotation part of the transform from the target. 

	 * $D_{shift}^2$ is the squared distance between `transform[3]` and `transform_regularize[3]`. I.e. the squared difference of the shift part of the transform from the target. 

	 So if a typical value of $D_{shift}$ (or $D_s$) is 2 and a typical value of $D_{scale}$ is 0.009, $\mu = 5\times10^4$. 

	Default: `5e4`

	 * For any given channel, the fraction of failed transforms was greater than `n_transforms_error_fraction` of tiles/rounds. 

	 * For any given tile, the fraction of failed transforms was greater than `n_transforms_error_fraction` of rounds/channels. 

	 * For any given round, the fraction of failed transforms was greater than `n_transforms_error_fraction` of tiles/channels. 

	Default: `0.5`

	Default: `0.5, 1, 5`

* **color_norm_probs**: *list_number*.

	Parameter used to get color normalisation factor. `color_norm_intensities` should be ascending and `color_norm_probs` should be descending and they should be the same size.

	Shift to apply to weighting of each background vector to limit boost of weak spots. The weighting of round r for the fitting of the background vector for channel c is `1 / (spot_color[r, c] + background_weight_shift)` so `background_weight_shift` ensures this does not go to infinity for small `spot_color[r, c]`. Typical `spot_color[r, c]` is 1 for intense spot so `background_weight_shift` is small fraction of this. Leave blank to set to median absolute intensity of all pixels on the mid z-plane of the central tile. 

	Default: `None`

* **dp_norm_shift**: *maybe_number*.

	When calculating the `dot_product_score`, this is the small shift to apply when normalising `spot_colors` to ensure don't divide by zero. Value is for a single round and is multiplied by `sqrt(n_rounds_used)` when computing `dot_product_score`.

	Spots used to compute `gene_efficiency` must have `dot_product_score` greater than `gene_efficiency_score_thresh`, difference to second best score greater than `gene_efficiency_score_diff_thresh` and intensity greater than `gene_efficiency_intensity_thresh`. 

	Default: `0.2`

Leave blank to determine from `gene_efficiency_intensity_thresh_percentile`. 

	Default: `None`

* **gene_efficiency_intensity_thresh_percentile**: *int*.
