# [Notebook](code/setup/notebook.md)

The *Notebook* is a write-once data structure which is saved as a npz file.
It stores the output of each stage of the pipeline as a separate *NotebookPage*. 
Each *NotebookPage* of the *Notebook* is itself a write-once data structure. 
Each *NotebookPage* may contain many different variables.

??? note "Times saved to *Notebook* and *NotebookPage*"

    Whenever a variable is added to a *NotebookPage*, in addition to saving the value, it saves the time
    at which the variable was added (`nbp._times`).  Likewise, the time at which a *NotebookPage* is
    created (`nbp._time_created`), and the time at which it is added to the *Notebook* (`nb._page_times`) 
    are also recorded automatically. The time the Notebook was created is also
    recorded (`nb._created_time`). This both serves as a record of what was done, as well as a
    source for debugging and optimization.

Conceptually, the idea is that a *Notebook* is like a lab notebook.  In a lab
notebook, you write things in a separate section (here, *NotebookPage*) for each part of
the experiment with the appropriate section name.  You only add, you never
erase or modify.  Lab notebooks contain intermediate results, as well as the
main data collected during the experiment.  All times and labels of all results
are written down.


## Create *Notebook*
To create a *Notebook*, pass it the path to the file where the *Notebook* is to
be saved (*/Users/user/coppafish/experiment/notebook.npz*) and the path to the configuration file
(*/Users/user/coppafish/experiment/settings.ini*):

``` python
from coppafish import Notebook
nb_file = '/Users/user/coppafish/experiment/notebook.npz'
ini_file = '/Users/user/coppafish/experiment/settings.ini'
nb = Notebook(nb_file, ini_file)
```

??? note "Create just using `config_file`"

    The *Notebook* can also be created with just the config_file through:
    ``` python
    from coppafish import Notebook
    ini_file = '/Users/user/coppafish/experiment/settings.ini'
    nb = Notebook(config_file=ini_file)
    ```
    The location where the *Notebook* is saved (nb._file) will then be set to:
    `config['file_names']['output_dir'] + config['file_names']['notebook_name']`.

If `nb_file` already exists, the *Notebook* located
at this path will be loaded.  If not, a new file will be created as soon as
the first *NotebookPage* is added to the *Notebook*. 

When the *Notebook* is created, it will save the contents of the configuration file (`nb._config`) thus
there is no need to pass the `config_file` argument when re-loading a *Notebook*. You can just
run `nb = Notebook('/Users/user/coppafish/experiment/notebook.npz')`.

??? note "Using *Notebook* outside the *coppaFISH* pipeline"

    Passing the configuration file to the *Notebook* allows for several [features](#configuration-file),
    however a *Notebook* can be created without it:
    ``` python
    from coppafish import Notebook
    nb_file = '/Users/user/coppafish/experiment/notebook.npz'
    nb = Notebook(nb_file)
    ```
    You can then still add *NotebookPages* to the *Notebook* as normal.

## Adding a *NotebookPage*
To add a *NotebookPage* called *page_name* with variable `var_1 = 5` to the *Notebook*, you can do the following:

``` python
from coppafish import NotebookPage
nbp = NotebookPage('page_name')
nbp.var_1 = 5  
nb += nbp  # or nb.add_page(nbp) or nb.page_name = nbp
```
    
Whenever a *NotebookPage* is added to the *Notebook*, it will trigger the *Notebook* to be saved (unless 
the *NotebookPage* has a name listed in `Notebook._no_save_pages`).
    
The variable `var_1` of the *NotebookPage* called *page_name* can then be accessed from the *Notebook* via
`nb.page_name.var_1`.

??? note "Adding variables to *Notebook*"
    
    Varibles of forms other than *NotebookPages* can be added directly to the *Notebook* e.g. `nb.var_1 = 5`.
    However, when the *Notebook* is saved and re-loaded, variables added in this way will no longer be
    present.

### Deleting a *NotebookPage*
To delete a *NotebookPage* called *page_name* which is in the *Notebook*, run `del nb.page_name`.

You may want to do this, for example, if you want to re-run a section of the pipeline with 
[different parameters](#configuration-file) in the corresponding section of the configuration file. 


## Modifying a *NotebookPage*
The *NotebookPage* is a write-once data structure so once a variable has been added to it, it cannot be 
changed (unless it is listed in `NotebookPage._NON_RESULT_KEYS`). I.e. the following will raise an error:

``` python
from coppafish import NotebookPage
nbp = NotebookPage('page_name')
nbp.var_1 = 5  
nbp.var_1 = 10
```

Once a *NotebookPage* has been added to a *Notebook*, `nbp.finalized` will change to `True` and no more variables
will be allowed to be added to the *NotebookPage*:

``` python
from coppafish import NotebookPage
nbp = NotebookPage('page_name')
nbp.var_1 = 5  
nbp.var_2 = 10  # fine as page not added to notebook yet
nb += nbp
nb.page_name.var_3 = 99 # will raise error as page is added to notebook now
```

To delete the variable `var_1` run `del nb.var_1`. Again, you won't be able to do this once the 
*NotebookPage* has been added to a *Notebook*.

## *coppaFISH* Specific *NotebookPages*
The names of all the *NotebookPages* added to the *Notebook* through the course of the pipeline are given as
the headers in the [*notebook_comments.json* file](notebook_comments.md). 
Then the bullet points give all the variables that are added to each *NotebookPage*.

When a *NotebookPage* has one of these names, an error will be raised if you try to assign a variable to it
which is not listed in the relevant section of the [*notebook_comments.json* file](notebook_comments.md). 
When adding the *NotebookPage* to the *Notebook*, an error will be raised unless it contains all 
the variables listed in the relevant section of the [*notebook_comments.json* file](notebook_comments.md)
and no others.

Examples of adding a *NotebookPage* named [*thresholds*](notebook_comments.md#thresholds) to a *Notebook*
are given below:

=== "✅"

    ``` python
    from coppafish import NotebookPage
    nbp = NotebookPage('thresholds')
    nbp.intensity = 0.01
    nbp.score_ref = 0.25
    nbp.score_omp = 0.263
    nbp.score_omp_multiplier = 0.95
    nb += nbp
    ```

=== "❌ Error adding variable to *NotebookPage*"

    ``` python
    from coppafish import NotebookPage
    nbp = NotebookPage('thresholds')
    nbp.intensity = 0.01
    nbp.var_1 = 5  # Error here as 'var_1' is not listed in 
                   # 'thresholds' section of notebook_comments.json
    ```

=== "❌ Error adding *NotebookPage* to *Notebook*"

    ``` python
    from coppafish import NotebookPage
    nbp = NotebookPage('thresholds')
    nbp.intensity = 0.01
    nbp.score_ref = 0.25 = 5  
    nb += nbp  # Error here as 'score_omp' and 'score_omp_multiplier' 
               # are listed in 'thresholds' section of 
               # notebook_comments.json but not added to page.
    ```

### Describe
The comments given in the [*notebook_comments.json* file](notebook_comments.md) can be accessed from 
the *NotebookPage* by calling the [`describe`](code/setup/notebook.md#coppafish.setup.notebook.NotebookPage.describe) 
function. An example to print the comment for the variable `gene_no` in the *omp* page is given below:

=== "Code"
    ``` python
    nb.omp.describe('gene_no')
    ```
=== "Output"
    ``` text
    Numpy int16 array [n_spots]
    gene_no[s] is the index of the gene assigned to spot s.
    ```

If [`describe`](code/setup/notebook.md#coppafish.setup.notebook.Notebook.describe) is called from the *Notebook* instead,
it will loop through all *NotebookPages* in the *Notebook* and print the comment for each variable with the correct
name that it encounters:

=== "Code"

    ``` python
    nb.describe('gene_no')
    ```
=== "Output"

    ``` text
    gene_no in ref_spots:
    Numpy int16 array [n_spots]
    gene_no[s] is the index of the gene assigned to spot s.

    gene_no in omp:
    Numpy int16 array [n_spots]
    gene_no[s] is the index of the gene assigned to spot s.
    ```

If [`describe`](code/setup/notebook.md#coppafish.setup.notebook.Notebook.describe) is called from the *Notebook* 
and finds the variable in the configuration file, it will print the section it was found in and its value. E.g.
for `dp_thresh` in the *omp* section:

=== "Code"

    ``` python
    nb.describe('dp_thresh')
    ```
=== "Output"

    ``` text
    No variable named dp_thresh in the omp page.
    But it is in the omp section of the config file and has value:
    0.225
    ```

### Configuration File
The configuration file can be returned as a dictionary of dictionaries from the *Notebook* by using the function
[`get_config`](code/setup/notebook.md#coppafish.setup.notebook.Notebook.get_config):

=== "Code"

    ``` python
    config = nb.get_config()
    ```
=== "config"

    ![image](images/config_dict.png){width="400"}

When the *Notebook* is re-loaded with a `config_file` (`nb = Notebook(nb_file, config_file)`), the configuration
file supplied will be [compared](code/setup/notebook.md#coppafish.setup.notebook.Notebook.compare_config) 
to the one saved in the *Notebook* (`nb._config`). 
If the comparison indicates that the two are different, an error will be raised.
Otherwise, when the *Notebook* is loaded, the saved value of the configuration file 
(`nb._config`) will be changed to the one given by the provided `config_file`.

???+ note "What is compared?"

    Each [*NotebookPage*](notebook_comments.md) added during the *coppaFISH* pipeline has a name which is the same as a 
    section in the [configuration file](config.md) or the same apart from a 
    [*_debug* suffix](notebook_comments.md#extract_debug).

    Only sections with a corresponding *NotebookPage* in the *Notebook* are compared.
    The [*file_names*](#file_names) section is also ignored in the comparison as it is included in 
    `Notebook._no_compare_config_sections`.

    So if the [pipeline](code/pipeline/run.md#coppafish.pipeline.run.run_pipeline) has been run as far as the
    [`call_reference_spots`](code/pipeline/call_reference_spots.md) 
    stage, the *Notebook* will not have the [*omp* page](notebook_comments.md#omp). 
    In this case, the [*omp*](config.md#omp) section of the `config_file` can be changed without causing an error
    as indicated below:
    
    === "nb._config (saved to *Notebook*)"

        ``` ini
        [file_names]
        input_dir = /Users/.../experiment1/raw
        output_dir = /Users/.../experiment1/output
        tile_dir = /Users/.../experiment1/tiles
        round = Exp1_r0, Exp1_r1, Exp1_r2, Exp1_r3, Exp1_r4, Exp1_r5, Exp1_r6
        anchor = Exp1_anchor
        code_book = /Users/.../experiment1/codebook.txt
    
        [basic_info]
        is_3d = True
        anchor_channel = 4
        dapi_channel = 0
        ```
    === "✅ Allowed `config_file`"

        ``` ini
        [file_names]
        input_dir = /Users/.../experiment1/raw
        output_dir = /Users/.../experiment1/output

        round = Exp1_r0, Exp1_r1, Exp1_r2, Exp1_r3, Exp1_r4, Exp1_r5, Exp1_r6
        anchor = Exp1_anchor
        code_book = /Users/.../experiment1/codebook.txt
    
        [basic_info]
        is_3d = True
        anchor_channel = 4
        dapi_channel = 0

        [omp]
        dp_thresh = 0.3452  
        ; Allowed because variable is in the omp section
        ; and omp page not added to Notebook yet.
        ```
    === "❌ `config_file` giving error"

        ``` ini
        [file_names]
        input_dir = /Users/.../experiment1/raw
        output_dir = /Users/.../experiment1/output
        tile_dir = /Users/.../experiment1/tiles
        round = Exp1_r0, Exp1_r1, Exp1_r2, Exp1_r3, Exp1_r4, Exp1_r5, Exp1_r6
        anchor = Exp1_anchor
        code_book = /Users/.../experiment1/codebook.txt
    
        [basic_info]
        is_3d = True
        anchor_channel = 4
        dapi_channel = 0

        [register]
        n_iter = 52  
        ; Not allowed because variable is in the register section
        ; but register page has been added to Notebook.
        ```

#### Changing *basic_info* mid-pipeline
It is quite common to want to change the *basic_info* section of the configuration file halfway through the pipeline
without re-running the steps of the pipeline which have already been completed.

For example, we may have specified the wrong `dye_names`, but this is not used until the `call_reference_spots`
stage. Or after the *find_spots* or *register* sections, we may want to remove some problematic 
tiles, rounds or channels (through `use_tiles`, `use_rounds` and `use_channels`).

But if the *basic_info* section of the configuration file is changed, 
an error would be raised unless the *basic_info NotebookPage* is deleted. The code below illustrates
how to save a new *Notebook* with a different *basic_info* page:

=== "Code"

    ``` python
    from coppafish import Notebook
    from coppafish.pipeline import set_basic_info
    nb_file = '/Users/user/coppafish/experiment/notebook.npz'
    
    # Save new notebook with different name so it does not overwrite old notebook
    # Make sure notebook_name is specified in [file_names] section 
    # of settings_new.ini file to be same as name given here.
    nb_file_new = '/Users/user/coppafish/experiment/notebook_new.npz'
    ini_file_new = '/Users/user/coppafish/experiment/settings_new.ini'

    # config_file not given so will use last one saved to Notebook
    nb = Notebook(nb_file)
    print('Using config file saved to notebook:')
    print(f"use_channels: {nb.basic_info.use_channels}")
    print(f"use_tiles: {nb.basic_info.use_tiles}")

    # Change basic_info
    del nb.basic_info     # delete old basic info
    nb.save(nb_file_new)  # save Notebook with no basic_info page to new file 
                          # so does not overwrite old Notebook
    # Load in new notebook with new config file with different basic_info
    nb_new = Notebook(nb_file_new, ini_file_new)
    # add new basic_info page to Notebook
    config = nb_new.get_config()
    nbp_basic = set_basic_info(config['file_names'], config['basic_info'])
    nb_new += nbp_basic
    print(f'Using new config file {ini_file_new}:')
    print(f"use_channels: {nb_new.basic_info.use_channels}")
    print(f"use_tiles: {nb_new.basic_info.use_tiles}")
    ```
=== "Output"

    ``` 
    Using config file saved to notebook:
    use_channels: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
    use_tiles: [0, 1, 2, 3]

    use_tiles = 0, 2, 3
    ```


#### *file_names*
The [*file_names*](notebook_comments.md#file_names) section of the *Notebook* is treated differently to deal with the 
case where the various file locations have changed e.g. when accessing them from a different computer.

The [*file_names*](notebook_comments.md#file_names) *NotebookPage*
is never saved when the *Notebook* is saved and adding a *NotebookPage* called *file_names* 
does not trigger a save. When the *Notebook* is loaded in, a [*file_names*](notebook_comments.md#file_names) 
*NotebookPage* will automatically be [created](code/setup/file_names.md) and added to the 
*Notebook* if the *Notebook* contains a [*basic_info*](notebook_comments.md#basic_info) *NotebookPage*.
The [*file_names*](notebook_comments.md#file_names) *NotebookPage* will then inherit information from
the [*file_names*](config.md#file_names) section of the `config_file` which was passed to the *Notebook* 
when loading it in as explained below:


=== "Code"

    ``` python
    from coppafish import Notebook
    nb_file = '/Users/user/coppafish/experiment/notebook.npz'
    ini_file = '/Users/NEW_USER/coppafish/NEW_EXPERIMENT/settings.ini'

    # config_file not given so will use last one saved to Notebook
    nb_old = Notebook(nb_file)  
    print('Using config file saved to notebook:')
    print(nb_old.file_names.output_dir)
    print(nb_old.file_names.big_anchor_image)
    # tile file path for round 0, tile 0, channel 0
    print(nb_old.file_names.tile[0][0][0])

    # config_file given so will update nb._config
    nb_new = Notebook(nb_file, ini_file)  
    print(f'Using new config file {ini_file}:')
    print(nb_new.file_names.output_dir)
    print(nb_new.file_names.big_anchor_image)
    # tile file path for round 0, tile 0, channel 0
    print(nb_new.file_names.tile[0][0][0])  
    ```
=== "Output"

    ``` text

Also, as soon as a *NotebookPage* named [*basic_info*](notebook_comments.md#basic_info) is added to the *Notebook*,
the [*file_names*](notebook_comments.md#file_names) *NotebookPage* will also be 
[added](code/setup/notebook.md#set_file_names) due to information in the `Notebook._no_save_pages` dictionary.
