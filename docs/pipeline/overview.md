# coppaFISH pipeline

Here we outline in detail, how each part of the pipeline works including what each parameter in
the configuration file is used for. Some useful [plots](../code/plot/viewer.md) 
that can be run for debugging purposes or to help understand what is going on are indicated. Potential
errors that can be hit during each stage of the pipeline are also mentioned.

Instructions on how to re-run a section of the pipeline are given [here](../run_code.md#re-run-section).
